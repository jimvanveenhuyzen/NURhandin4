\section*{Code of Problem 3}

The code is included below. Like in the previous hand-ins, I use code between sub-questions so I found that having one big .py file per problem is the most efficient.

\section*{Problem 3a}

The 2D slices of the density contrast $\delta$ are plotted below at $z$ = 4.5, 9.5, 11.5 and 14.5 respectively as a colormap. Note here that positive values in the colorbar on the side correspond to overdensities relative to the mean density of the volume, while negative values indicate underdensities.
